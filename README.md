Blackjack is a card game between players and a dealer. In this project, I coded the game for one person to play against the dealer. The goal of the game is for the player's cards to total more than the dealer's without going over 21.

In this implementation, two cards will be dealt to the player and the dealer. One of the dealer's cards will remain hidden until the player is done with their cards. The player can continue to "hit" if they would like to risk another card.
